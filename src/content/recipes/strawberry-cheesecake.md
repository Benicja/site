instructions:
  - step: "Crumble the biscuits in a mixing bowl (using a pestle or mixer). Melt the butter and mix it with the biscuit crumbs, sugar, and whisk in the egg."
  - step: "Line the bottom of a springform with a sheet of baking paper. Press the crumb mixture into the tin, pushing it up the sides a little. Refrigerate the crumb mixture while you prepare the filling."
  - step: "Set the oven to 160°C (fan-assisted), otherwise 185°C."
  - step: "Whisk the Philadelphia cheese and sugar with an electric whisk until smooth. Pour in the vanilla sugar while you do so."

  - step: "Pour the filling into the tin and bake at the bottom of the oven for 50-60 minutes."
  - step: "The cake should be a bit wobbly when you take it out; it will firm up as it cools."
  - step: "Once completely cool, spread a nice even layer of jam over the top."

This is our absolute favorite cheesecake recipe. It's light, zesty, and the crème fraîche gives it a wonderful creamy texture that isn't too heavy. Perfect served with a few fresh berries on the side.
