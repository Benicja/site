    amount: "250g (1 1/4 cups)"

    amount: "1 tsp"
  - item: "Vanilla extract"
    amount: "1 tsp"
  - item: "Icing sugar (optional, for torching)"
    amount: "2 tbsp"
instructions:
  - step: "Preheat the oven (with a baking sheet inside) to 200°C (390°F) (top-bottom heat)."
  - step: "Grease a 23cm springform cake tin with butter. Line the bottom and sides with baking paper so it extends 4–5cm above the rim."
  - step: "Blend the biscuits into a fine crumb and mix with the melted butter. Press firmly into the bottom of the tin. Bake for 6 minutes until \"dried out,\" then set aside to cool."
  - step: "Increase oven temperature to 240°C (460°F) (or 220°C/430°F if your oven runs hot). Ensure it is thoroughly preheated."
  - step: "In a large bowl, whisk the cream cheese and sugar for 2–3 minutes until smooth and slightly fluffy."
  - step: "Add the Greek yogurt, salt, and vanilla. Whisk until incorporated."
  - step: "Add the eggs one at a time, whisking just until combined after each addition. Finally, pour in the double cream and whisk briefly to combine."
  - step: "Place the cake tin on the preheated baking sheet in the oven. Bake for 30–35 minutes. The cheesecake should be dark brown (almost burnt) on top but still very \"wobbly\" in the center when shaken."
  - step: "Let the cheesecake cool completely at room temperature, then refrigerate for at least 8 hours to reach the perfect consistency."
  - step: "(Optional) If the top isn't dark enough, sprinkle with icing sugar and caramelize with a kitchen torch. Serve chilled."

# Cheesecake (Basque Style)

This "Better than Ever" Basque Cheesecake is a compromise between the classic San Sebastián version and the modern "lava" style. It features a caramelized, dark top that masks an incredibly creamy interior.

The addition of salt and vanilla enhances the flavor, while the strained Greek yogurt adds a delightful tang and lightness to the rich cream cheese base. For best results, ensure your yogurt is well-strained to remove excess moisture.
